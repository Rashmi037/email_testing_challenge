Duplicate email address should be handled by Email service. Current behaviour is to send response status 500 which should we modified to send 400 (bad request). 
Under heavy load, when too many request are sent to Email service, it returns 500 response intermittently rather it should 
retun 202 accepted or 429 too many request to let client stop bombarding requests.

For validation, I have tried covering all the edge cases.

The challenging part I found is that since I am not having control over third party.
I had to modify the code. If the third party API call has been externalised then there would not have been any need to touch the code.

So, for the test cases where third party timeouts or is down. I have created the mock service. 
For mocking, I have used the already existing mocking library that is using sinon.
The good part of mock library is that we have the control over it.
